<h2>Tools Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Axios</li>
  <li>Jokes by API-Ninjas</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I used React for designing the simple front-end, axios for making HTTP requests and Jokes by API-Ninjas API from rapidAPI to fetch the jokes from their database. It was a fun little project I worked on while I was bored in my internship to brush up fetching data from external API's.</p>
